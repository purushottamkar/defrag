# DEFRAG

## Introduction
Accelerating Extreme Classification via Adaptive Feature Agglomeration

# Running DEFRAG
DEFARG is executed in two steps:
- defrag_clustering: This computes a grouping of features.
- derag_agglomeration: This agglomerates the features based on groupings obtained from previous step.

Please refer to sample_run.py for more information on how to use DEFRAG.
